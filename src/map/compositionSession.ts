/**
 * Session memory **per composition** — `TASK-0019` §4.7.
 *
 * `L9` asks that `C2` and `C3` each keep their own pan, zoom and selection,
 * and that `C2 → C3 → C2` give `C2` back **exactly**. That is a memory keyed
 * by the composition, and nothing more.
 *
 * **The key is the ordered list of displayed `brain_id`** — `brain-alpha|brain-gamma`.
 * Deterministic, because `composeView` always returns catalogue order: two
 * ways of arriving at the same composition land on the same entry rather than
 * on two entries that each hold half the state.
 *
 * **It subsumes the per-brain memory of `TASK-0018` rather than competing with
 * it.** A composition of one brain has the key `brain-alpha`, which is exactly
 * the key `brainSession.ts` used, so the single-brain behaviour `K8` froze is
 * the same behaviour — not a re-implementation of it. That is what `L9`'s last
 * sentence asks for.
 *
 * **It is session-only, and says so.** Nothing here is written to disk.
 * Persisting a composition across a restart is out of scope; only the **active
 * brain** survives a restart, in the catalogue, as `K9` established.
