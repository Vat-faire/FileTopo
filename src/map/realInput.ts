 * event — one whose `isTrusted` is `false`.

 * instruments are read at once: `isTrusted` on the activation, the count of
 * programmatic `click()` calls and `click` dispatches over the whole window,
 * and the observable change itself. If the keystroke never arrives, the caller
 * fails; there is no fallback to a synthetic click, here or anywhere.
