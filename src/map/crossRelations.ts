/**
 * Inter-brain relation helpers — `TASK-0020`.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and works on the DTOs the common store returns.
 * Nothing derives a relation, invents an inverse, or promotes a suggestion:
 * the model decides those, in Rust, and this file only groups and projects
 * what it is given.
 *
 * **The one difference from `relations.ts`, and it is the whole point.** An
 * intra-brain segment lives in one brain's coordinates and is drawn inside one
 * territory. An inter-brain segment has **one end in each of two brains'
 * coordinates**, and is drawn across the gap between two territories. So it
 * carries its two brain ids, and `MapView` looks up **two** offsets rather than
 * one. There is no arithmetic here that mixes the two spaces — mixing them is
 * exactly how an edge would end up drawn inside the wrong brain.
