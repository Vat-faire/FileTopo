/**
 * Reserve `X5` — the guard that keeps a later task from overwriting the
 * canonical evidence of an earlier `VERIFIED` one.
 *
 * `map_write_run_artifact` writes by **replacement**. `TASK-0018` migrated the
 * measurement loop and the relations scenario to brains but left them writing
 * `TASK-0016-H9-webview2.json` and `TASK-0017-J12-webview2.json`, so pressing
 * a button in the current runtime would have destroyed two published proofs.
 * These tests fail if that ever comes back — including through a literal
 * spelled out again somewhere instead of imported from `runArtifacts.ts`.
 *
 * **`X5` extends when a task is verified.** `ACTION-0029` made `TASK-0018`
 * `VERIFIED` and `ACTION-0031` made `TASK-0019` `VERIFIED`, so their own proofs
 * — including the regression artefacts they produced themselves — joined the
 * protected list, and the `TASK-0020` runtime writes under `TASK-0020`. The
 * rule did not change; the list it applies to grew twice, and that growth is
 * what the tests below hold.
 *
 * **`ACTION-0032` made `TASK-0020` `VERIFIED`**, and the list grew a third
 * time. `TASK-0022` renamed its current outputs, leaving the protected/runtime
 * intersection empty until the current task itself became verified.
 *
 * **`ACTION-0036` made `TASK-0022` `VERIFIED`**. Exactly its eight canonical
 * proofs are sealed; H9, K12 and every abandonment variant remain noncanonical
 * and unprotected.
 *
 * **`ACTION-0039` made `TASK-0023` `VERIFIED`**, and the list grew a fifth
 * time — by exactly two names, the `EC15` passes it was controlled on. Every
 * other artefact `TASK-0023` wrote stays unprotected, because a verification
 * seals the evidence it ruled on and not everything the slice happened to
 * produce.
 *
 * That extension also closes the intersection question the other way round:
 * this checkout still writes `EC15`, so for the first time since `TASK-0020`
 * the runtime spells a sealed name, `writesUnderItsOwnTaskOnly` is `false`,
 * and the tests below assert that state rather than treating it as a failure.
 *
 * The three executable guards — Rust, TypeScript, PowerShell — must carry the
 * same twenty-nine names in the same order.
