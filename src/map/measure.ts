/**
 * The `H9` measurement harness: frame times and selection latency, inside the
 * real engine.
 *
 * `H9` sets **no frames-per-second target**. Success is obtaining the numbers
 * honestly and publishing them without favourable selection — every run counts,
 * and the worst is reported beside the median. Nothing here filters, discards a
 * run, or smooths a curve.
 *
 * What is actually measured, stated plainly so nobody has to infer it:
 *
 * * **frame time** — the interval between two consecutive animation-frame
 *   callbacks while a scripted pan-and-zoom drives the map. It includes the
 *   React commit and whatever the engine schedules around it. It is *not* a
 *   paint timer.
 * * **selection latency** — from the moment a selection is requested to the
 *   start of the frame following the one that paints it, measured with two
 *   chained animation frames.
