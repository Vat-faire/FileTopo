/**
 * The map itself: **one** accessible `SVG`, holding one territory per brain.
 *
 * SVG rather than Canvas or WebGL, per `DEC-0013` C and `DEC-0015` E — both of
 * which remain closed. The layout is read from the index and only ever
 * transformed here; nothing on this path recomputes a rectangle, which is what
 * `H10` asserts and what `L5` now asserts for a composition.
 *
 * **One canvas, not three stacked maps** — `TASK-0019` §4.3. A composition of
 * one brain and a composition of three go through *this* component, on the
 * same code path: the single-brain case is a composition of one, so nothing
 * about it can drift away from the composed case.
 *
 * **Transforms nest, so nothing is re-projected.** Blocks are drawn in each
 * brain's own layout coordinates, inside a group translated by that brain's
 * territory offset, inside a group carrying the global pan and zoom. A frame
 * therefore costs two attribute writes rather than thousands of DOM writes —
 * and, more importantly, **the rectangles in the DOM are bit-for-bit the ones
 * the index holds**, whatever the composition and whatever the zoom. `L5` is
 * not a discipline here; it is the shape of the tree.
 *
 * The labels are the exception: they live in a screen-space layer, because
 * text that scaled with the map would be illegible at one end of the zoom
 * range and absurd at the other.
 *
 * **`L3` — DOM identity.** Alpha and Gamma read the same fixture, so
 * `map-node-6` exists in both. Every node id is therefore namespaced by its
 * brain — `brain-alpha-map-node-6` — and the selection that travels is a
 * `BrainNodeRef`, never a bare row number.
 *
 * **`TASK-0020` — edges that really cross.** `L8` forbade any edge from
 * crossing a territory boundary, and that was right while no model carried such
 * a link. `M6` now asks for the opposite, for **one** kind of edge and only
 * that one: an inter-brain relation is drawn from a rectangle in one brain's
 * coordinates to a rectangle in another's, each translated by **its own**
 * territory offset. The two kinds never share a code path, so an intra-brain
 * edge still cannot leave its territory — that is not discipline, it is that
 * `RelationSegment` carries one brain id and `CrossSegment` carries two.
