/**
 * `K12` of `TASK-0018`, replayed against the real host, unattended.
 *
 * **A regression replay owned by `TASK-0019`.** The criterion is `TASK-0018`'s
 * and is not retouched; what changed is the control it is driven through. The
 * single brain selector no longer exists — `TASK-0019` §4.4 replaced it with
 * the composition bar — so the scenario switches brain by **adding** the one
 * it wants and **removing** the one it was on, both by real keystrokes. The
 * end state of each switch is the same as before: exactly one brain displayed,
 * focused and active. Its evidence is written under a `TASK-0019` name, and
 * `TASK-0018`'s own four proofs are protected at the write gate.
 *
 * The twelve steps of §4.8 run in the order they were frozen, driven through
 * the **same** commands a person would use. Every count comes back from a
 * command; nothing here recomputes one.
 *
 * **Two passes, because step 11 says "la redémarrer".** A restart cannot be
 * faked from inside a page: steps 1 to 9 run in the first process and write
 * their evidence, the host is really closed, and steps 10 to 12 run in the
 * second process and read the catalogue back. `scripts/k12-run-real-host.ps1`
 * is what closes and relaunches; the two artefacts stand on their own and name
 * the process that produced them.
 *
 * **`K10` — a real keystroke.** Switching brains in this scenario is done by
 * keys the operating system delivers, not by anything the page dispatches:
 * the control is focused, a marker is printed, and
 * `scripts/j12-send-real-key.ps1` sends the key through `WScript.Shell`. The
 * same three instruments as `J12` are read — `isTrusted`, the count of
 * programmatic clicks over the whole window, and the observable change. If the
 * keystroke never arrives, the pass fails; it never falls back to a click.
