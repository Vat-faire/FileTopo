//! Inter-brain relations — `TASK-0020` §4.
//!
//! `TASK-0017` gave a brain relations **inside itself**. This gives two brains
//! a relation **between** them, and the difference is not cosmetic: three
//! questions have to be answered before a single line can be drawn from one
//! territory to another.
//!
//! **Where does a relation live when it belongs to neither brain?** Not in
//! Alpha's private store: a rebuild of Alpha would then destroy a link Gamma is
//! half of, and Alpha would hold authority over data it does not own alone. So
//! the store is **common and separate** — `brains/interbrain/relations.sqlite`
//! — beside the brains rather than inside one, outside every rebuildable
//! `map/`, and outside the catalogue.
//!
//! **How does an endpoint survive a rebuild?** `map_nodes.id` are row numbers
//! and a rebuild renumbers them. An endpoint is therefore a **versioned key**,
//! `cek1|<brain_id>|<relative_path>`, resolved to whatever `node_id` the index
//! currently holds. **This is not `I-E`**: `VolumeSerialNumber` + `FileId` and
//! real moves and renames stay outside this slice, and this is the declared
//! deterministic fallback.
//!
//! **What is a relation to a brain nobody is looking at?** Still a relation.
//! Nothing in this file knows what is on screen: the store is independent of
//! the composition, and the interface decides what to say about a brain that is
//! not displayed.
//!
//! Two properties are structural rather than enforced by discipline:
//!
//! * **There is no `provenance` column.** Which table a row is in *is* its
//!   provenance, exactly as in `TASK-0017`. A relation without provenance is
//!   unrepresentable, not merely forbidden.
//! * **`source_brain_id <> target_brain_id` is a `CHECK`.** An "inter-brain"
//!   relation inside one brain cannot be written, whatever the caller does.
