//! What the inter-brain relations view calls, and the resolution behind it.
//!
//! The store speaks in **`cek1` endpoint keys**, which survive a rebuild; each
//! map speaks in **node ids**, which do not. This file is the one place the two
//! meet — and unlike `TASK-0017`'s, it has to meet them in **several brains at
//! once**, because the two ends of a relation live in two different indexes.
//!
//! Three rules hold this file together.
//!
//! * **Each end resolves in the brain its own key names.** Never in the brain
//!   that happens to be open, never in "the other one". `brain-alpha` and
//!   `brain-gamma` read the same tree, so a resolution that took the wrong
//!   index would find a plausible node and be silently wrong.
//! * **An unresolved endpoint is reported, never dropped.** A brain whose index
//!   has not been built yet is a *stated* outcome — `brainIndexed: false` — not
//!   an error banner and not an omission.
//! * **Nothing here knows what is on screen.** The composition is not an
//!   argument, is not read, and does not change a single result. Whether a
//!   brain is *displayed* is the interface's business; whether it is *indexed*
//!   is this file's.
