//! Where the slice is allowed to write.
//!
//! Three destinations, and nothing else:
//!
//! * `fixtures/` — the synthetic trees the slice analyses. **Never a user
//!   folder**: the slice ships no folder picker, and `TASK-0016` §12.4 keeps
//!   real data as a stop point reserved to Sébastien. A fixture root is
//!   **shared** by every brain that reads it, and read **only**.
//! * `brains/` — everything FileTopo knows about a brain, **namespaced by
//!   `brain_id`** (`TASK-0018` §4.4): the common catalogue, then one index and
//!   one relations store **per brain**.
//! * `runs/` — measurement artefacts, development builds only.
//!
//! **The namespace is the `brain_id`, never the source.** `brain-alpha` and
//! `brain-gamma` read the same fixture and must not share a byte of FileTopo
//! state, so their storage is separated by a **directory**, not by a column
//! somebody could forget in a `WHERE` clause. `K3` compares the two paths and
//! fails if they ever meet.
//!
//! The `TASK-0016`/`TASK-0017` layout — `maps/<fixture>/` and
//! `relations/<fixture>/` — keyed FileTopo state by the **source**, which is
//! exactly the confusion `DEC-0017` removes. Those directories may still exist
//! in a developer's sandbox; **nothing here reads or deletes them**, and no
//! accessor leads to them any more.
//!
//! In a development build the sandbox sits in the repository, under the
//! git-ignored `.filetopo-sandbox/`, so every piece of evidence stays
//! inspectable without leaving the repository. A release build has no
//! repository to find and falls back to the application's own data directory.
//!
//! ## Variants — a FRESH namespace for a proof run
//!
//! The development sandbox is **persistent**, which is what makes it
//! inspectable, and also what made `L12` step 7 of `TASK-0019` impossible to
//! replay: an earlier run had already approved `S-005`, so the **act** the
//! criterion asks for could not happen again. Reserve `X6`.
//!
//! Deleting the sandbox would be a destruction, and a stop point reserved to
//! Sébastien. So nothing is deleted: a proof run asks for a **new namespace**
//! instead, through `FILETOPO_SANDBOX_VARIANT`, and gets
//! `<dépôt>/.filetopo-sandbox/variants/<variant>` — still **inside** the same
//! directory, never anywhere else. The existing sandbox stays exactly where it
//! is, untouched.
//!
//! Two properties hold the mechanism in place:
//!
//! * **Absent variable, byte-identical behaviour.** No variant means
//!   `<dépôt>/.filetopo-sandbox`, exactly as before.
//! * **Confinement, not a destination.** The variable carries a **name**, never
//!   a path: one ASCII basename, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, 1 to 64 characters. A
//!   separator, a `..`, an absolute path or an empty string is an **explicit
//!   error** — never a silent fall back to something a caller supplied. The
//!   slice still ships no folder picker and no user-chosen root.
