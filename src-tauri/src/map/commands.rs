/// Canonical evidence of tasks already `VERIFIED` — **never a destination**.

/// scenario a later slice migrated but did not rename would silently destroy
/// the published proof of an earlier task. The rule is enforced here, at the
/// only door, rather than trusted to every caller: a later task's execution
/// never replaces an earlier `VERIFIED` task's evidence.
///
/// Renaming or removing one of these files is a governance act, not a
/// runtime one; nothing in the application does it.
///
/// **The list grows when a task becomes `VERIFIED`.** `TASK-0018` was
/// `IMPLEMENTED` when this gate was written and `VERIFIED` by `ACTION-0029`,
/// so its four proofs joined the list — including the regression artefact it
/// produced itself, which is now somebody else's canonical evidence.
///
/// **`TASK-0019` is `VERIFIED` since `ACTION-0031`**, so its **six** proofs
/// join in turn and the list goes from eight names to fourteen. Four of them
/// are themselves regression replays `TASK-0019` produced; being a replay does
/// not make evidence less canonical once the task that published it has been
/// controlled. `TASK-0020` therefore writes **nothing** under a `TASK-0019`
/// name: its own regressions are published under `TASK-0020-` names, and this
/// gate is what makes that a refusal rather than a convention.
///
/// **`TASK-0020` is `VERIFIED` since `ACTION-0032`**, so its **five** proofs
/// join in turn and the list goes from fourteen names to nineteen. The
/// consequence is deliberate and worth stating plainly: the scenarios still
/// compiled into this runtime spell those five names as their destination, so
/// pressing those buttons now yields a **refusal** instead of a write. That is
/// the gate working, not a regression. `TASK-0020` is finished and controlled;
/// no legitimate execution needs to write those files again, and the next
/// slice republishes its replays under **its own** task name, exactly as
/// `TASK-0020` did for `TASK-0019`.
///
/// **`TASK-0022` is `VERIFIED` since `ACTION-0036`**, so its **eight**
/// canonical proofs join the list, which grows from nineteen names to
/// twenty-seven. Its `H9` was not run, its `K12` outputs were not published as
/// `TASK-0022` evidence, and no `-abandon` variant is canonical; none of those
/// names is protected.
///
/// **`TASK-0023` is `VERIFIED` since `ACTION-0039`**, so its **two** canonical
/// proofs — the `EC15` `pass1` and `pass2` of the exact content observations,
/// run in the real WebView2 host — join the list, which grows from
/// twenty-seven names to twenty-nine. `TASK-0023` published many other
/// artefacts: the `H9`, `J12`, `K11`, `K12`, `L12`, `M12` and `N15` replays it
/// migrated, and every `-abandon` variant. **None of those is canonical
/// evidence of `TASK-0023`** and none is protected; only `EC15` carried the
/// criterion the task was controlled on.
///
/// The consequence is again deliberate, and again worth stating plainly: the
/// content scenario compiled into this checkout still spells those two `EC15`
/// names as its destination, so replaying it now yields a **refusal**. That is
/// the gate working. The next slice migrates the destination under its own
/// task name before it replays anything, exactly as every previous slice did.
