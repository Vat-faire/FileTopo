.SYNOPSIS
    Runs the two passes of L12 (TASK-0019) against the real host, with a real
    close and a real restart between them.

.DESCRIPTION
    L12 has seventeen steps, and steps 15 and 16 say « fermer réellement » and
    « redémarrer réellement ». A restart cannot be faked from inside the page,
    so the criterion needs a driver outside it:

      pass 1  FILETOPO_AUTO_COMPOSED=1  steps L12.1 to L12.14
      close   the window is really closed, and the process really exits
      pass 2  FILETOPO_AUTO_COMPOSED=2  step  L12.17

    Each pass writes its own artefact under docs/performance/runs/, and the two
    stand on their own: the second proves nothing about the first except that
    the ACTIVE BRAIN survived it — and that the composition did NOT, which is
    the declared limit of this slice rather than a defect of it.

    L10 needs REAL Windows keystrokes: steps 3, 8, 13 and 14 are performed by
    keys the operating system delivers. This script therefore starts
    scripts/j12-send-real-key.ps1 alongside pass 1 — the same watcher, on the
    same marker convention, so there is one implementation of « a real key »
    and not three. The page prints `L12-KEY-READY`, which the watcher's default
    `-KEY-READY` already matches.

    Each invocation asks the application for a FRESH sandbox namespace —
    FILETOPO_SANDBOX_VARIANT, confined to <depot>/.filetopo-sandbox/variants/ —
    so step 7 can really approve S-005 instead of finding it already approved.
    The existing sandbox is NOT touched and the variant is NOT removed: nothing
    is deleted anywhere, which is what reserve X6 asks for.

    Nothing here touches the analysed trees, the repository beyond the run
    artefacts the application itself writes, or any user data. The only process
    it stops is the one it started.

.PARAMETER Executable
    The FileTopo binary to run. Defaults to the DEBUG build in the checkout.

    Debug, deliberately. `map_write_run_artifact` exists only in a debug build
    — a release build answers `run_artifacts_unavailable_in_release` — so a
    release binary cannot write the evidence L12 is for. Build it with:

        pnpm tauri build --debug --no-bundle

    which produces the same bundled front end as a release build, running on a
    binary that can still write its own evidence.

.PARAMETER LogDirectory
    Where the two run logs go. Defaults to the system temporary directory, so
    no log lands in the repository.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
    How long each pass may take before this script gives up and says so.

# Reserve X6 — a FRESH sandbox namespace, and NOTHING deleted.
#
# L12 step 7 asks for an ACT: approve S-005 in Alpha, and confirm Gamma did not
# move. The development sandbox is persistent, so an earlier run had already
# approved it and the act could not happen again — the relations store refuses a
# second approval, which is X3 working, not a defect.
#
# Erasing the sandbox to get back to a pending S-005 would be a DESTRUCTION, and
# a stop point reserved to Sébastien. So nothing is erased: this run asks the
# application for a NEW namespace under the same directory, and the existing
# sandbox stays exactly as it is.
#
#   <depot>/.filetopo-sandbox/variants/<variant>
#
# A fresh namespace means a fresh catalogue, a fresh Alpha index and a fresh
# Alpha relations store — so S-005 is pending, and the approval is a real act.
# The variant is a NAME, never a path: the application validates it and refuses
# anything else. Both passes share the SAME variant, which is what lets pass 2
# find the brain pass 1 left active.
#
# The directory is deliberately NOT removed afterwards: the evidence needs no
# deletion, and a later invocation simply creates another variant.
